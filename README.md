# Siamese Neural Network with Triplet Loss trained on MNIST

This notebook builds an SNN to determine similarity scores between MNIST digits using a triplet loss function. The use of class prototypes at inference time is also explored. 

This notebook is based heavily on the approach described in [this Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/siamese-network-triplet-loss-keras/), which in turn is based on the [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) paper. Any uses of open-source code are linked throughout where utilised. 

For an in-depth guide to understand this code, and the theory behind it, please see LINK.
